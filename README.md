# 🤖 Smart Robotic Arm: Torque Analysis & Motor Selection

This project analyzes the torque requirements at each joint of a robotic arm to lift payloads of 1 kg and 2 kg, guiding optimal motor selection and mechanical design.

## 📐 Arm Dimensions
- Segment 1: 10 cm → 0.10 m  
- Segment 2: 15 cm → 0.15 m  
- Gripper Segment: 4 cm → 0.04 m  
- Total Reach (from base to gripper): 0.29 m

## 📌 Task 1: Torque Calculation for 1 kg Payload

- Mass: 1 kg  
- Gravity (g): 9.81 m/s²  
- Force: 1 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 9.81 N  

### ✅ Required Torque at Each Joint

| Joint   | Distance from Joint to Gripper (m) | Torque (Nm) |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Joint 1 | 0.29                                | 2.84        |
| Joint 2 | 0.19                                | 1.86        |
| Joint 3 | 0.04                                | 0.39        |

## 📌 Task 2: Torque Calculation for 2 kg Payload

- Mass: 2 kg  
- Force: 2 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 19.62 N  

### ✅ Updated Torque Requirements

| Joint   | Distance (m) | Torque (Nm) |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Joint 1 | 0.29         | 5.69        |
| Joint 2 | 0.19         | 3.73        |
| Joint 3 | 0.04         | 0.78        |

## ⚙️ Motor Suitability

Motors should provide at least 1.5× the maximum required torque for safety and dynamic movements. Gearboxes can multiply torque but add complexity.

### ✅ Advantages of Gearboxes
- Allow smaller motors to lift heavier loads.
- Reduce required motor size and cost.

### ⚠️ Drawbacks of Gearboxes
- Reduce arm speed.
- Increase energy consumption.
- Add mechanical wear and complexity.
- Can cause control precision issues if not tuned properly.

## 💡 Design Notes

- Always calculate static torque using:  
  \[
  \tau = m \times g \times r
  \]

- Select motors with torque at least 1.5× your calculated maximum to account for dynamic effects.

- Reducing arm length or using lightweight materials can drastically lower required torque.
